## Describe original program.
The original program was to use the multiplication method that the ancien egiptions would use.

## What files are part of the original solutions?
I only had one file with the whole program multiplier.py.

## What files are part of your converted solutions?
multiplier_main.cpp , multiplier_functions.cpp , multiplier_func_tester.cpp

## What challenges did you have converting your program?
I had to use vectors insted of lists to sort and add number together.

## What language was better suited for the task? Explain why?
Im not sure both see equaly well suited to making a program like this. We also made the python project before we knew how to use functions.
