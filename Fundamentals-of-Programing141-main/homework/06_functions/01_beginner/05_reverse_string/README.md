# CPTR 141: Objective #6 (1 point)

## Problem Overview

Your task in this homework assignment is to write a function returns the reverse of a provided string of characters. For example, if the string "Python" is given, this function should return "nohtyP".

## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must define a function `reverse_string` in the file `reverse_string.py` that has a single string parameter.

2. The function must return the reverse of the provided string.

3. The file `reverse_string.py` should not contain a main program, it should only contain your function. To test your function, add code to the `reverse_string_test.py` file. Note that code in `reverse_string_test.py` will not be graded.

4. Below is an example of a call to the `reverse_string` function which you could implement in `reverse_string_test.py` to test your function.

    Python Code:
    ```python
    my_string = "Python"
    result = reverse_string.reverse_string(my_string)
    print(result)
    ```

    Output:
    ```html
    nohtyP
    ```
