# CPTR 141: Objective #4 (4 point)

## Problem Overview

Your task in this homework assignment is to write a program that mimics the functionality of an ATM machine. It prompts the user for an account number and 
PIN code.  If it finds a match, it then allows the user to check his or her balance, make a deposit, or make a withdraw (assuming there is enough money in the account). Note that you should update the balance so that future calculations are based on the revised value.

## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must use `input` and `print` to get data from the user and display output.

3. You must format your code using the "Format Document" command in your development environment.

4. You **must** produce the same output as the example program `solution.pyc` when run with any inputs.  Run this program in a terminal with the command `python3 /home/project/code/python/student141/homework/04_branching/04_expert/01_atm_simulator/solution.pyc`. Once it is running try entering various combinations of values. Note that the left-click before the right-click in step 1, you may need to answer *yes* to the prompt that comes up.

## Grade Specification

You will earn **four points** for completion of this homework problem once your solution passes all Submitty tests (indicated by all green bars).
