## Problem Overview

Your task in this homework assignment is to write a program that determines if two given sets have a non-empty intersection and outputs the results.

## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must use `print` to display output.

2. You must compute the intersections of the set `icecreams.set_one` with `icecreams.set_two` and the set `icecreams.set_one` with `icecreams.set_three`, all of which are found in the provided `icecreams` module.
