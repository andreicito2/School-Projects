# CPTR 141: Objective #3 (4 point)

## Problem Overview

Your task in this homework assignment is to write a program that prompts the user for information about three pets, including the name, type of pet, and the year in which the pet was born. The program stores this information in three lists using the pet number as the key (i.e. 0, 1, and 2). Finally, the program prompts the user for a year and then prints the names and ages of all three pets in that year.


## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must use `input` and `print` to get data from user and display output.

2. You must save the pet information to three different parallel lists.

    + The `pet_name` list should contain the names of the three pets
    + The `pet_type` list should contain the type (bird, fish, etc) of the three pets
    + The `pet_born` list should contain the birth year of the three pets

3. You must then prompt the user for a year and print out the names and types (in all lower case) of all three pets with their ages in that year.

2. You must format your code using the "Format Document" command in your development environment.

3. You **must** produce output exactly as shown below, assuming the user enters the information shown.

```html
First Pet's Info:
=================
Name: Gus
Type: Cat
Birth Year: 2020

Second Pet's Info:
==================
Name: Minerva
Type: Cat
Birth Year: 2009

Third Pet's Info:

In 2025, the ages of your pets will be:
  - Gus the cat will be 5
  - Minerva the cat will be 16
  - Thunder the fish will be 4
