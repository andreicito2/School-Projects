# CPTR 141: Objective #3 (4 point)

## Problem Overview

Your task in this homework assignment is to write a program that prompts the user for two points on the coordinate plane and stores them as (x,y) tuples.  The program then displays the equation of the line connecting those points.  You may assume that the slope of the line exists (i.e. that it is not vertical).

## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must use `input` and `print` to get data from user and display output.

2. You must save the floating-point coordinates to two tuples named `point_one` and `point_two`.

3. You must print the equation of the line using two decimal places of accuracy.

2. You must format your code using the "Format Document" command in your development environment.

3. You **must** produce output exactly as shown below, assuming the user enters "-1.5", "3", "3", and "11.5".

```html
Enter First Point
=================
x-coordiante: 1.5
y-coordinate: 3
Point #1 is (1.5,3.0)

Enter Second Point
==================
x-coordinate: 3
y-coordinate: 11.5
Point #2 is (3.0,11.5)

Equation
========
The equation of the line through the points (1.5, 3.0) and (3.0, 11.5) is:
y = 5.67x + (-5.50)
```
