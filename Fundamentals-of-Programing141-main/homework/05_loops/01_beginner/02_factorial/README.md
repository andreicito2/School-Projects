# CPTR 141: Objective #5 (1 point)

## Problem Overview

Your task in this homework assignment is to write a program that outputs the factorial of a given non-negative integer.  Recall that the factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers from 1 up to and including `n`.  That is:

```html
n! = 1 * 2 * ... * n
```

## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must use `input` and `print` to get data from user and display output.

2. You must use a `for` loop to assist in computing the factorial.

3. You must format your code using the "Format Document" command in your development environment.

4. You **must** produce output exactly as shown below, assuming the given user inputs.

```html
Enter the value for which you wish to find the factorial: -10

Error! Factorial does not exist for negative numbers.
```

```html
Enter the value for which you wish to find the factorial: 5

5! = 120
```

## Grade Specification

You will earn **one point** for completion of this homework problem once your solution passes all Submitty tests (indicated by all green bars).
