# CPTR 141: Objective #2 (1 point)

## Problem Overview

Your task in this homework assignment is to write a program that outputs the area of the circle of a given radius with three decimal places of accuracy.

## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must use `input` and `print` to get data from the user and display output.

2. You must use arithmetic expressions to compute the area of the circle and you must use the `math.pi` constant from the `math` module.

3. You must use formatting to display the area with three decimal places of accuracy (but the radius has no such restriction; it should be printed as entered).

4. You must format your code using the "Format Document" command in your development environment.

5. You **must** produce output exactly as shown below when a radius of 4 is entered.

```html
Enter the radius: 4

The area of the circle is 50.265 when the radius is 4.0.
```
