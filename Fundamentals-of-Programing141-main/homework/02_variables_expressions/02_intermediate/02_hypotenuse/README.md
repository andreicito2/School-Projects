## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must use `input` and `print` to get data from the user and display output.

2. You must use arithmetic expressions to compute the length of the hypotenuse.

3. You must use formatting to display the length with three decimal places of accuracy.

4. You must format your code using the "Format Document" command in your development environment.

5. You **must** produce output exactly as shown below assuming legs of length "5" and "5" are specified.

```html
Enter leg A length: 5
Enter leg B length: 5

The hypotenuse of a right triangle with leg lengths 5 and 5 is 7.071.
```
